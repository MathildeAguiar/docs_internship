# Day by day journal 

*In this journal you will find sum ups of my work each day* 

### 10/05/21:

First day of my internship. We discussed the tasks and goals related to my internship. 
The internship is divided in 2 parts :

* First, the Web application the consist of a learning environnement where a language/linguistics teacher can choose from different tags and properties to auto-generate an exercice corresponding to some learning goals. 
For the Web app we use the Python Flask framework. However the previous app was coded in Php-laravel which we now find kind of unnapropriate so we want to migrate all of the previous app content to a Flask version. 
The front-end of the app represents the "student's side". This part also uses Ajax for a dynamic and immadiate correction of the student's answers. 
The back-end side is the "teacher's side" where they can decide the parameters of the exercice. 


* The second part (reseach part) consists of creating/defining a model that can tackle the grammatical features of the texts used by the teachers and labels those grammatical features. An approched we discussed could be to consider blocs (S-V-O in French for example) within the sentence instead of the word itself to find out the grammatical relationships that exists between them.

Part 1 of the tutorial is done. 



### 11/05/21:

* I keep following the OC Falsk tutorial. I almost finished reading it all (except the chapter dedicated to Facebook and the last 2 ones). 
* I created the website up to chapter "d√©coupez votre projet en templates". However it's still messy and need to be cleaned up.

**TO DO TOMORROW** 

- [ ] Finish the website dev according to the OC tutorial and use all the facebook features she displays on the tutorial.
- [ ] Fill up the Trello. 
- [ ] Think about a generic website model that could fit our project and start to build up the architecture.

### 12/05/21:

* I decided to start again from the beginning the coding of the OC tutorial's website. I cleaned up the code and encountered a few (stupid) bugs. I just need to set up all the facebook stuff and it will be done.
