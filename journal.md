# Day by day journal 

*In this journal you will find sum ups of my work each day* 

### 10/05/21:

First day of my internship. We discussed the tasks and goals related to my internship. 
The internship is divided in 2 parts :

* First, the Web application the consist of a learning environnement where a language/linguistics teacher can choose from different tags and properties to auto-generate an exercice corresponding to some learning goals. 
For the Web app we use the Python Flask framework. However the previous app was coded in Php-laravel which we now find kind of unnapropriate so we want to migrate all of the previous app content to a Flask version. 
The front-end of the app represents the "student's side". This part also uses Ajax for a dynamic and immadiate correction of the student's answers. 
The back-end side is the "teacher's side" where they can decide the parameters of the exercice. 


* The second part (reseach part) consists of creating/defining a model that can tackle the grammatical features of the texts used by the teachers and labels those grammatical features. An approched we discussed could be to consider blocs (S-V-O in French for example) within the sentence instead of the word itself to find out the grammatical relationships that exists between them.

**TO DO THIS WEEK** 

- [ ] Initialize the Trello board
- [ ] Do the ![OpenClassroom's](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/4425066-concevez-un-site-avec-flask/) tutorial on Flask. My repo is ![here](https://github.com/MathildeAguiar/FlaskTutorial)

--- 

Part 1 of the tutorial is done. 



### 11/05/21:

* I keep following the OC Falsk tutorial. I almost finished reading it all (except the chapter dedicated to Facebook and the last 2 ones). 
* I created the website up to chapter "d√©coupez votre projet en templates". However it's still messy and need to be cleaned up.

---

**TO DO TOMORROW** 

- [ ] Finish the website dev according to the OC tutorial and use all the facebook features she displays on the tutorial.
- [ ] Fill up the Trello. 
- [ ] Think about a generic website model that could fit our project and start to build up the architecture.

### 12/05/21:

* I decided to start again from the beginning the coding of the OC tutorial's website. I cleaned up the code and encountered a few (stupid) bugs. I just need to set up all the facebook stuff and it will be done. 


### 13/05/21: 
*holiday but couldn't help to touch the code*

* Added a few changes to the new website version. 
* Found out that the facebook authentification couldn't be done because of non https adresses that no longer supported. However, specified in the FB documentation localhost should work anyway. Still trying to figure out this bug. This thing keeps me from testing my full website which is really frustrating. 
 
### 14/05/21:

**TO DO TODAY** 

- [ ] Finally filling up that Trello and watch vids/read docs about how Kanban really works
- [ ] Still looking for the fb authentification bug
- [ ] Sketch a new website interface 

--- 
Facebook **troubleshooting** :
Facebook only works with https URL since 2018. However my Flask application uses the classical http form of the localhost. I need to enable the https version of my local host. To do so I found a solution ![here](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/running-your-flask-application-over-https). To sum up I just need to change the **app.run()** in my run.py file and add the argument **ssl_context='adhoc'** . However, with just this argument we have a security problem message from the web browser. To solve this problem we can generate a self-signed certificate with openssl. Use the command: `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem -days 365`
Then modify again the **app.run()** args with:
`ssl_context=('cert.pem', 'key.pem')`

Well, it seems to not work well for now. I still have the same URL problems.

### 17/05/21:

I read the doc about Flask-WTF, bootstrap-flask and SQLite. I used the sample SQLite ![database](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/) to develop a little website where you fill up a form (using flask-wtf) that can browse through the sqlite sample database. I used the following ![tutorial](https://hackersandslackers.com/flask-wtforms-forms/) for the wtf form. 
So far, I did the form, howerver the sql queries are still missing. I must finish to set up the whole database (sqlachemy part) and write the queries.   
I must set up the bootstrap part. 

---
**TO DO TOMORROW**

- [ ] set up the bootstrap
- [ ] write queries
- [ ] finish to set up the database

### 18/05/21:

Meeting with Yannick this morning. 
The result page is fixed and the database is set up. I need to finish the queries and set up the bootstrap. 

### 19/05/21:

* I set up the bootstrap Flask on my Collection de Disques website. Now we have a beautiful form.
* I messed up with the database (I defined the database like SQLAchemy one instead of a SQLite one) so I have to redo that.
* I made some prototypes of the ihm we want for our final application
* I started to setch an architecture of the files needed to create the final application

### 20/05/21:

I worked on the database again. I had troubles with the queries and the database so I worked on that part.

### 21/05/21:
The database is set and so the queries. I still have to do a few ajustments in the way it appaears on screen.

### 25/05/21:

Meeting with Yannick. I showed my current version of Collection de Disques. We decided that I will keep working on this but with transposing the chinook database into what our final application could look like. 

---

**TO DO THIS WEEK**

- [ ] Use the chinook database as a reference to keep working on the collection de disques website. Be careful on how we could use it to do a transposition to the final website.
- [ ] Keep working on the interface sketches.
- [ ] "Test" my interfaces on my teacher mom to see if it would be easy to use  

* I transposed the chinook database for our use with teachers. 
* I sketch 2 more interfaces. 

*I forgot to update it here oops*

### 26/05/21:

* I started working on the bootstrap part. I tried different options but I still struggle to get what I want. 
* I added new queries corresponding to some teacher's needs. I want to display the results in a table using **render_table()** from bootstrap flask. However I still need to manage it properly.

### 27/05/21:

* I changed some things in my mock-ups. I added some few animations. Almost all the mock-usps first version are ready to get tested by the teacher.
* Still managing the way bootstrap side navs are displayed.

### 28/05/21:

* I cleaned the code with a better architecture.
* I'm still trying to display the bootstrap the way I want with using at most the bootstrap flask.
* I finished the first animated/linked version of the mock-ups. Testing them on the teacher this Sunday.

### 31/05/21:

* I changed some queries and I displayed the results in better shape than before.
* I tried different ways to use bootstrap.
* I had feedback from the teacher yesterday. I did a few adjustments to the mock-ups. 

### 1/06/21:

Meeting with Yannick. We discussed about some adjustments about the future interface. We decided that I will be doing the following work this week:
- [ ] From the previous search form that I did on chinook, design a search form where the teacher could look for "anything" they want, a free search form.
- [ ] Design the questions validation interface with a table where we could modify/approve/disapprove the question found by our engine.
- [ ] Design the interface for the exercise editing.

* I finished creating my base (header/footer/nav) for all pages. Finally clean!
