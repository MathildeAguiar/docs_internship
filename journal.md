# Day by day journal 

*In this journal you will find sum ups of my work each day* 

### 10/05/21:

First day of my internship. We discussed the tasks and goals related to my internship. 
The internship is divided in 2 parts :

* First, the Web application the consist of a learning environnement where a language/linguistics teacher can choose from different tags and properties to auto-generate an exercice corresponding to some learning goals. 
For the Web app we use the Python Flask framework. However the previous app was coded in Php-laravel which we now find kind of unnapropriate so we want to migrate all of the previous app content to a Flask version. 
The front-end of the app represents the "student's side". This part also uses Ajax for a dynamic and immadiate correction of the student's answers. 
The back-end side is the "teacher's side" where they can decide the parameters of the exercice. 


* The second part (reseach part) consists of creating/defining a model that can tackle the grammatical features of the texts used by the teachers and labels those grammatical features. An approched we discussed could be to consider blocs (S-V-O in French for example) within the sentence instead of the word itself to find out the grammatical relationships that exists between them.
